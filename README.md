# SlimeVR-Duel
(I do not own SlimeVR, I am only making a different variant of their IMU trackers.)
SlimeVR Duel is the same as normal SlimeVR trackers except they use 2 IMUs to help with drift and accuracy! It takes the data of 2 BMI160s that are in series and send the data to the Slimevr server after filtering the data.  

(Here is the official SlimeVR website/docs: https://docs.slimevr.dev/index.html )

THIS IS VERY BETA! I'M STILL WORKING ON THE CODE OF THIS!
However, Help is very appreciated!
